## Shunshin

### Introduction
---

Shunsin is Koto's first product which revolves around unique yield strategies. Anyone is able to create a new vault and implement their own strategies within that vault. The intent is to allow individuals to take advantage of Koto's vault system without the requirement of needing to build out their own website, marketing, and everything else that would go into a typical strategy. 

The implementors of strategies are able to profit off of their own unique strategies through a multitude of ways, including fees and bribe profits. 

The core vaults can be found within the main repository as well as Koto created strategies. There is no specific strategey implementation that is required and it is entirely up to the individual developers to decide what a strategy might entail.

Bribe Market Place

Each strategy has the potential to reward individuals who participate within that strategy. Bribe tokens can be selected by the creator of the strategy at the time of implementation or at a later date. Users are then able to participate within the ecosystem by locking Koto tokens for a specific amount of time depending on how much voting power they would desire to have vs their willingness to lock themselves within a position. Votes determine the amount of Koto that is directed to a given strategy for a given week and will be stay at that rate for the entirety of the epoch.
